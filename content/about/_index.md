I'm a recent graduate from Portland Community College's Computer Aided Design and Drafting program.
I have studied and designed for multiple manufacturing processes. In June 2022 I received the
Apprentice Mechanical Drafter Certification from ADDA.

I am skilled at utilizing SolidWorks, Inventor, Fusion360, and AutoCAD for my designs.
